# Automatic-Answer-Evaluator

In the current education system, exams and assessments are the primary means of evaluating the knowledge and skills of students. However, traditional examination methods often rely on subjective evaluations by human examiners, which can lead to inconsistencies in grading and evaluation. This is where the concept of automatic answer script evaluation by AI comes into play


The proposed work aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate subjective answers of students in exams. This is done by training the AI models on large datasets of answers along with their respective grades. The AI models can then be used to automatically grade the answers of new students in real-time, eliminating the need for human intervention


The importance of this proposed work lies in its potential to overcome the limitations of traditional subjective evaluation methods. With AI-based evaluation,
 
there is no scope for human error or bias, making the grading process more accurate and consistent. Moreover, AI-based evaluation can handle a large number of answer scripts in a short time, reducing the turnaround time for exam results


In traditional subjective examination methods, answer scripts are evaluated manually by human examiners. This process can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors. On the other hand, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the evaluation of subjective answer scripts can offer several advantages, such as faster evaluation, objective grading, and consistency in grading


The proposed work aims to develop an AI-based system for the automatic evaluation of subjective answer scripts. The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to understand and evaluate the answers provided by the students


The importance of this proposed work lies in its potential to transform the subjective examination process. With the increasing number of students appearing for competitive exams, the traditional manual evaluation process can become a bottleneck in the examination process. By using AI-based systems for evaluation, the process can become faster, more objective, and reliable


The results of the proposed work will be evaluated based on the accuracy of the system's evaluation compared to human evaluators. The system will be trained on a dataset of answer scripts and will be tested on a separate dataset. The comparison of the system's evaluation with that of human evaluators will help in determining the effectiveness of the proposed system
 
The comparison of the proposed work with existing methods will also be an important aspect of the study. The existing methods of automatic answer script evaluation mostly focus on objective-type questions and use pattern recognition techniques. The proposed work, on the other hand, focuses on subjective answers and uses NLP and ML techniques. The comparison of the proposed work with existing methods will help in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach


Overall, the development of an AI-based system for the automatic evaluation of subjective answer scripts has the potential to revolutionize the examination process. It can help in reducing the burden on human examiners, make the evaluation process more objective and reliable, and improve the efficiency of the examination process
